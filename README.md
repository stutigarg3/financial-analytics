# Exploring CAPM with SP500 stock's Beta Exposure using R

## Introduction

The financial analytics project titled "Exploring CAPM with SP500 stock's Beta Exposure using R" delves into the world of finance and data analysis. Through leveraging the capabilities of R, a versatile data analysis tool, this project investigates the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and its practical applications. We embark on a journey that encompasses collecting historical stock price data for IBM and the market index, rigorous data cleaning, and transformation to ensure data accuracy. The ultimate goal is to utilize predictive modeling through linear regression in R to compute IBM's beta, a crucial risk assessment metric for investors.

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Acquisition:** Collect historical stock price data for IBM and the market index.
2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Ensure data accuracy through rigorous cleaning and transformation processes.
3. **Predictive Modeling:** Utilize R's statistical capabilities to estimate IBM's beta exposure to the market.

## Data Acquisition

To begin, historical stock price data for IBM and the market index was sourced. This involved accessing reliable financial databases and APIs to gather comprehensive datasets for analysis.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation

Data cleaning is a critical step in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our analysis. This phase involved handling missing values, addressing outliers, and transforming the data into a suitable format for modeling.

## Predictive Modeling

The heart of the project lies in the predictive modeling phase. Leveraging R's powerful linear regression capabilities, we compute IBM's beta exposure to the market. This step allows us to quantify the stock's risk in relation to the overall market.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the importance of data acquisition, data cleaning, and data transformation in the realm of financial analytics. By demonstrating the practical use of R in predictive modeling, we provide insights into IBM's beta exposure, a crucial metric for investors. The skills acquired through this project empower individuals to make informed investment decisions and optimize portfolio management strategies.
